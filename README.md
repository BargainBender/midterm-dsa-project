### Problems in the society

Wood is an essential material for the economy. It is seen and used in a wide array of products.
So naturally, incredible amounts of wood is used by us humans. This comes with a big problem -
deforestation.

### Proposed Computing Solution
Create a Java software for the government & logging that keeps track of the following data in order
to help maintain forest health and tree density:
 - trees ready to be cut
 - wood available / needed
 - land available for planting
 - land planted w/ trees
 
### Title of the Project
"Illegal Tree Cutting Prevention & Security Software

### Use the following modules
 - arrays (1D, 2D)
 - classes
 - ArrayList
 - stack
 - sorting

### Application of the modules
 - arrays (1D, 2D)
  - 2D - map / grid of areas / trees
 - OOP implementation
  - UI
  - MVC pattern
  - use of classes for various objects / entities
 - ArrayList
  - type of woods available
  - customers/orders
 - Stack
  - undo / redo actions
 - Data that needs to be sorted
  - order date
  - order quantity
  - types of wood
